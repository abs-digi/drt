**The cerebrum (front of brain) consists of two hemispheres. Each hemisphere is further broken into four sections called lobes.**
* **Frontal** - The frontal lobe, located in the front of the head, is involved in personality characteristics, decision-making and movement. Recognition of smell usually involves the frontal lobe. It contains Broca's area, which is associated with speech ability.
* **Parietal** - The middle of the brain. It helps a person identify objects and understand spatial relationships. It is also involved in interpreting pain and touch in the body. It houses Wernicke's area, which helps the brain understand spoken language.
* **Temporal** - The sides of the brain. It involves short-term memory, speech musical rhythm and some degree of smell recognition.
* **Occipital** - The back of the brain. It's involved with vision.
