A fleeting note is a raw, unprocessed capture of an idea. It is not intended to be permanent or polished. Instead, it serves as a "placeholder" in your inbox to be reviewed and either discarded or transformed into a more structured [[Digital Garden/Literature Note\|Literature Note]] or [[Digital Garden/Permanent Note\|Permanent Note]] within 24–48 hours.



"Spur of the moment" and "fleeting notes" are two sides of the same coin: one is the **behavior**, and the other is the **tool**.

To correlate them, you can think of the "spur of the moment" as the **triggering event** and the fleeting note as the **capture mechanism**.

### The Correlation: Impulse vs. Capture

| Aspect             | Spur of the Moment (The Impulse)                                                                                | Fleeting Note (The Action)                                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature**         | **Internal & Spontaneous.** A sudden flash of insight, a connection between two ideas, or a "lightbulb" moment. | **External & Physical.** The scribbled sentence, the 10-second voice memo, or the digital "inbox" entry. |
| **Timing**         | Happens while doing something else (driving, showering, mid-conversation).                                      | Must be executed immediately to prevent the "decay" of the thought.                                      |
| **Cognitive Load** | High energy but low duration. If not captured, it creates "open loops" in your brain.                           | Low energy. It closes the "open loop" by offloading the thought to a system.                             |
### Why "Spur of the Moment" Requires a Fleeting Note

In cognitive psychology, specifically **Zeigarnik Effect** logic, an unfinished thought or a "spur of the moment" idea creates mental tension. Your brain tries to hang onto it, which distracts you from what you are currently doing.

1. **Preservation of Context:** A spur-of-the-moment idea is often highly dependent on what you are doing _right then_. If you don't take a fleeting note, you lose the "why" behind the idea.
    
2. **The "Working Memory" Bridge:** Our working memory can only hold about 4–7 items. A spur-of-the-moment thought is an "intruder" in that space. The fleeting note acts as an external hard drive, allowing you to clear your working memory and return to your task.
    
3. **Validation:** Not every spur-of-the-moment thought is a stroke of genius. The fleeting note allows you to "capture now, judge later." By the time you review it (usually 24 hours later), the "spur of the moment" emotion has faded, and you can see if the idea actually has objective value.

### The Risk: The "Collector's Fallacy"

The strongest correlation between these two is the danger of **over-collection**. If you act on every "spur of the moment" impulse by creating a fleeting note but _never_ process them, you end up with a "digital graveyard."
