#Zettelkasten in German means "slip box". It's a note taking system used by many people to organize thoughts. It's main purpose was to produce published work. "Fruit" so to speak as we'll use in my [[Digital Garden/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]]. Zettelkasten was created By: [[Digital Garden/Niklas Luhmann (1927–1998)\|Niklas Luhmann (1927–1998)]]. He was best known for Grand Social Theory and Productivity. With the  Zettelkasten, he published over 70 books and 400 articles. In recent years he has become well known in the productivity and "Personal Knowledge Management" (PKM) communities. The Zettelkasten operated like this. He would label A6 index cards by alphanumeric numbers e.g. 1/1, 1/1a, 1/2 and put single ideas, thoughts on them. When a new idea related to 1/1a he would label it 1/1a1 and so forth. With this he created a web of ideas, not a linear archive.
