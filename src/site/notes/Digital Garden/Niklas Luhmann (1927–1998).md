#Niklas #Luhmann (1927–1998) was a German sociologist and one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century. He is best known for two things that are often discussed in very different circles:
- Grand Social Theory: He created a radically different way of looking at society known as Systems Theory, which argues that society is made of communication, not people.
- Productivity (The [[Digital Garden/Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]]): He famously published over 70 books and 400 articles, a feat he credited entirely to his unique note-taking system, the [[Digital Garden/Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]] (slip-box).
